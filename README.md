# Badge_Documentation

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that handles badge URLs stored in a `.txt` file. The notebook reads the URLs, filters out duplicates, formats them into HTML `<img>` tags, sorts them alphabetically by badge name, and prints out the sorted badges both in HTML format and as a list separated by pipes.
